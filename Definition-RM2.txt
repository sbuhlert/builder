means the ready-to-use 68GaRM2 as a radiopharmaceutical investigational medicinal product. 68Ga-RM2 is a PET imaging agent specifically designed to target the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), which is overexpressed in several cancers, particularly prostate cancer. Specifically, it is a radiolabeled peptide (C49H66N12O10) tracer, derived from the precursor bombesin, a 14-amino acid peptide analog, and conjugated with a chelator (DOTA, tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid) to enable stable binding and stability in vivo of the radiometal isotope
