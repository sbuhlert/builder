"PI-2620 is a fluorine-18 (18F) labeled PET imaging agent designed to selectively bind to tau protein aggregates in the brain, facilitating the visualization of tau pathology associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD).

It is composed of a tricyclic molecule with the formula C₁₅H₉FN₄ and a molecular weight of 264.26 g/mol, having been optimized for high affinity and selectivity toward tau aggregates, as well as favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including efficient blood-brain barrier penetration and rapid clearance from non-target regions."
